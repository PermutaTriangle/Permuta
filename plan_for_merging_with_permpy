Plan on merging permpy into permuta by forking permpy into permpy_documentation_for_permuta
and make comments on functions when we merge them in. Not everything should go
into permuta:

These should go into permuta
avclass -> AvoidanceClass
permutation.py -> merge with permuta

InsertionEncoding -> new repo that imports permuta

geometricGridclasses -> into the above


permclass -> ?/bisc



misc.py -> ?

TRASH
mperm.py (multiset permutations) -> ?
onefile.py -> ?
def_inf_P_to_I(P,I) -> ?? WAT
statistics.py -> keep separately inside permuta
RestrictedContainers -> new repo that imports permuta

vector.py and vector_set.py -> needed by peg permutations
pegpermset.py and pegpermutation.py -> new repo for gridclasses and geometric gridclasses
